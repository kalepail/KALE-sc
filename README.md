`KALE` is a Stellar asset that can only be created by mining it through this contract. Only one unit (`1_0000000`) of the asset can be farmed every minute.

Network | `TESTNET` | `MAINNET`

Contract | `CCETM7JZP6IUFTYZUOHI6OF3O4I4HXB3LCPISFSFCAEBCWGEOBLRSOBL` | `NA` 
Asset | `KALE:CBUFOFYUEPAPCKI2HE2KM24DN22LMFFR4MY6X77CNQLS6OAADRDFIWTE` | `KALE:NA`

## The Mining Process

In order to successfully farm `KALE` into your account you must carry out 3 steps:
1. Start by invoking the `plant` function.
2. Next input your proof of work by calling the `work` function.
3. Finally you can harvest your `KALE` by calling the `harvest` function.

## Attribution
The KALEpail project wouldn't have been possible without the initial innovation of the [FCM project](https://github.com/Stellar-Corium/FCM-sc) or the subsequent community efforts spearheaded by [Frederic 경진 Rezeau](https://github.com/FredericRezeau/fcm-miner).
